    <h1> Who are we? </h1>
      <p>
        Brainswipes.us is run by the Developmental Cognition and Neuroimaging (DCAN) lab. Our work focuses on advancing the understanding of brain development in health and disease.
      </p>
      <p>
        We specialize in using a type of neuroimaging called resting state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging to study the brain across development (from infancy to aging), in different disorders (ADHD, autism, Parkinsonâ€™s Disease), and across different species (humans, non-human primates and rodents). We combine this technique with multiple other neuroimaging, behavioral and biological measures.
      </p>
    <h1> Why do we need this app? </h1>
      <p>
        Our research involves using large-scale neuroimaging datasets. We want to be sure that the data that we use and share with the broader community has undergone effective quality control. BrainSwipes leverages crowdsourcing to review and rate large amounts of data quickly, making our results more replicable and reliable.
