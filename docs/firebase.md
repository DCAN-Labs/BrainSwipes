# Firebase
Brainswipes uses several Firebase tools. The instance for this project is [here](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/brainswipes/overview). Log in with the DCAN Labs google account to gain access and set new users.

## Realtime Database
BrainSwipes uses a Realtime Database for storing data. This tracks data generated by the application.
The Realtime Database is a user friendly NoSQL database system. Think of it as a giant JSON!
You can edit the database right in the browser, or download the entire database or sections of it as a JSON file, edit it, then reupload. If you're nervous about making changes, download the entire database beforehand as a way to restore it if things go wrong.

Uses Firebase Rules to manage read/write permissions for the database. If you are running into issues reading/writing new sections of the database this is probably why.

## Authentication
BrainSwipes uses Firebase Authentication for account management. This handles creation of users from their email. Information about a user is programatically accessed with Firebase's JavaScript SDK during runtime.

## Admin SDK
The BrainSwipes application uses the Firebase Admin SDK to store data on account access. [Custom Claims](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/admin/node/firebase-admin.auth.userrecord.md#userrecordcustomclaims) are assigned to each user to determine access and admin status for each study. This is only accessible with the Admin SDK.
